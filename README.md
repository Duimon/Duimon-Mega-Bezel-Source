# HSM-Source

This repo contains Adobe Illustrator files and supporting assets for my HSM graphics. They are also used as the base for my RA Overlays, and Hybrids.

**Many of the AI files have the raster effects resolution set to 72dpi to save space. They MUST be set to 300dpi to replicate my work.**
