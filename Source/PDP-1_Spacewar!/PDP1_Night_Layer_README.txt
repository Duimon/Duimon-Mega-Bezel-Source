The saved PNG from Photoshop will, by default, have a black matte embeded as the
alpha layer. This matte, though invisible, will effect the transparent part of
the screen because the Night Lighting uses a multiply blend. After saving the
PNG, load it into Photoshop and on the menu bar go to "Layer > Matting > Remove
Black Matte". Save the file.
